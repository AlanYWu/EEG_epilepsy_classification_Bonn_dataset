# Continuous Ambulatory Epilepsy Prediction System Incorporating Feature Engineering

Dataset: Bonn University's Epileptology department EEG dataset

Dataset information: The dataset was from surface and intracranial EEG recording from healthy volunteers, and the intracranial EEG recordings from epilepsy patients when they are having seizures or in the interictal phase. All channels are separated and in a random series. Each piece of recording has a duration of 23.5 seconds with frequency of 173.61 Hz. All artifacts are removed by human experts. 

The model used is base on Manoosh Samiei's workflow from https://github.com/ManooshSamiei/EEG_epilepsy_classification_Bonn_dataset.

The trained model is one the file named EEG_Classification_Without_Wavelet_Decomposition.ipynb. The highest accuracy reached 100% on the dataset.

The source code for plotting the graph in the article is also provided in the dataset named Plotting the seizure and nonseizure data.
